## About the Collection

This is a demo collection generated by Dria L using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

I want to learn how to use the Github web interface to make collections for my LIS 2222 class and beyond!

## Collection History

This collection was pulled from the demo files provided by the CollectionBuilder tutorial.

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
